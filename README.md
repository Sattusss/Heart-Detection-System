## Introduction

Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can help in reducing the risk and improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on multiple clinical features.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sattusss/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data, train models, and make predictions.

```bash
jupyter notebook Heart\ Disease\ Prediction.ipynb
```
